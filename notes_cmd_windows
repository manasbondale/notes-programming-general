"NUL" or invalidly named files cannot be manually deleted.
As the filename itself is invalid.
Windows parses the filename before deleting and this is where the error occurs.
To delete such a file use the following command-line to rename it without parsing it.
C:\> rename \\.\C:\...\NUL. deletefile.txt
and then delete it.
The string "\\.\" tells the command-prompt not to parse the filename during execution of command.
