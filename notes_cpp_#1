For header files :
#ifndef HEADERFILENAME_H
#define HEADERFILENAME_H
//your code
#endif

-Prevents recursive and double inclusion, are called include guards

command line:

gcc -std=c++11 -o filename main.cpp main2.cpp ....

-std= c++11 c++14 c++17

The following are deprecated 0x 1y 1z

-x specifies explicitly the language to be used //unnecessary

-o filename
filename is the name of the .out file . default is a.out

-O
-O1
-O2
-O3

optimizations. O < O1 < O2 < O3. Increase performance of out file. But also increases compile time.

main.cpp main2.cpp ...

list of files (cpp) to be compiled in the output file filename.out
There can only be one main function among all the files.

Slicing is when a derived class object is assigned to a base class object. member variables unique to the derived class belonging to this derived class object lose their value because of the assignment to base class object.
