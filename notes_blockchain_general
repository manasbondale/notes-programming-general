Mining

the proof of work relies on the difficulty of generating a hash.
while a hash is easy to generate, there are in place some arbitrary constraints on what the hash can be.
in a simplified version, there need to be a certain number of zeroes at the start of a hash for it to be valid.
after each unsuccessful attempt at generating a hash that did not meet the requirements, a '_nNonce' variable is updated so that the next hash generated is different.

for bitcoins, the difficulty sets itself in a way that at the rate at which currently mining is being by all miners, they can all in total generate only 2016 blocks every fortnight : that's 1 block every 10 minutes.

currently the award/bounty for generating a block is 12.5 bitcoins per block. this rate halves every 210000 blocks.
eventually as this bounty dwindles the incentive for mining a block will mainly rely on the transaction fees collected for every transactions. this also gives miners an incentive to include as many transactions as they can into one block.

Hashing

Hashes used  hash256 = sha-256(sha-256(d)) and hash160 = RIPEMD-160(sha-256(d)) returning 32 byte and 20 byte hash respectively

hash256 is used for identifier which identify blocks and transactions. a hash256 is unique to its block and you are guaranteed that it will be never be repeated again for another block in the future.\
