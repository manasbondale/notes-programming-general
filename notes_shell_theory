Shell theory
stdin stdout stderr are the input output and error streams respectively

Environment variables
In commandline instruction these must be referenced by prepending $ to their name. e.g. $PATH or $$
${PATH} also works the same

HOME home dir
PATH path env
UID user id
USER user name
PWD present working directory
SHELL name of the shell
$ process id
PPID parent process id
? exit code of previously executed command.

History
history is on by default.
To turn it off :~$ set +o history
To turn it on :~$ set -o history

PATH is colon-separated directories where bash will search for commands to execute from

Functions
testfunc () { echo "$# $@ parameters"; echo "$1"; }

$# is number of parameters
$1 is the first parameter
$@ all the parameters altogether in order of passing

testfunc e r t
3 e r t parameters e

There must be a space between { and the first line of function body/ commandline.

To test whether a directory already belongs to PATH:
$ augpath = ":$PATH:" //creates string array delimited by ':'
$ augdir = ":<yourdirectory>:" // creates same as above but with only <yourdirectory> as member
$ test "$augpath" != "${augpath/$augdir}" && echo Found || echo Not Found

"${augpath/$augdir}" creates a string array delimited by ':' that is basically augpath without augdir
test returns 0 if != and then executes echo Found
test returns 1 if == and then executes echo Not found
